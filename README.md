# daily-practice
Hello! In this repository, I'll be sharing the small projects I create daily to keep up with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These projects help me stay in practice and retain what Iâ€™ve learned, while also building a portfolio of work. Feel free to explore, and hopefully, these projects will be helpful or inspiring to others as well!

## Projects
- `project-1` (Login Form) : I have designed a login page for a charity run event with basic HTML and CSS styling.
